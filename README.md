# WordPressComKit

This library will be equivalent to [wpcom.js](https://github.com/Automattic/wpcom.js) for iOS/Mac/tvOS application. There are several ideals surrounding this library:

1. Wrap all basic WordPress.com REST API functionality in a reusable, lightweight service layer.
1. Delegate persistance to consuming application. At some point in the future the caching could be heavier like in the [Parse SDKs](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX).
1. Include Authentication for OAuth2 as a service.
1. Delivery as a CocoaPod or Carthage dependency.
1. Unit test everything.
